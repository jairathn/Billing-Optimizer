# Medical Necessity Documentation for Dermatology

## Overview

Medical necessity is the foundation of all billing. Services must be documented as reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness/injury. This document outlines documentation requirements by procedure type.

---

## General Principles

### What Medical Necessity Requires

1. **Clinical indication** - Why is this service needed?
2. **Appropriateness** - Is this the right service for the condition?
3. **Standard of care** - Does this meet accepted medical practice?
4. **Not convenience** - Not primarily for patient/provider convenience

### Documentation Elements

Every procedure note should include:
- Chief complaint or reason for procedure
- Clinical findings supporting the procedure
- Diagnosis or suspected diagnosis
- Procedure performed
- Findings/outcome

---

## E/M Medical Necessity

### Established vs New Patients

**New patient (99202-99205):** First visit or no face-to-face service in past 3 years

**Established patient (99211-99215):** Seen within past 3 years

### MDM Support Documentation

| MDM Level | Problems | Data | Risk |
|-----------|----------|------|------|
| Straightforward | 1 self-limited problem | Minimal/none | Minimal risk treatment |
| Low | 2+ self-limited OR 1 stable chronic | Limited data | Low risk treatment (OTC, topicals) |
| Moderate | 1+ chronic with mild exacerbation OR 2+ chronic stable | Moderate data | Moderate risk (Rx management) |
| High | 1+ chronic with severe exacerbation OR acute threat | Extensive data | High risk (drug toxicity, surgery) |

### G2211 Documentation

**Required elements:**
- Chronic condition identified
- Statement of ongoing management/relationship
- Medical necessity for continued care

**Example:** "Continued management of chronic plaque psoriasis. This visit represents ongoing care within established patient-physician relationship."

---

## Biopsy Medical Necessity

### Documentation Requirements

| Element | Required | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Lesion description | YES | "Irregular pigmented macule with variegated color" |
| Location | YES | "Left shoulder" |
| Indication | YES | "Rule out melanoma" OR "Diagnose rash" |
| Clinical concern | YES | "Recent change in size reported by patient" |
| Technique | YES | "Shave biopsy performed" |

### Diagnosis Considerations

**Biopsy justified when:**
- Clinical diagnosis uncertain
- Need to rule out malignancy
- Direct pathologic confirmation needed for treatment
- Prior treatment failed, need tissue diagnosis
- Monitoring for recurrence/progression

**Document clinical reasoning:**
> "Atypical appearing nevus with asymmetry, border irregularity, and color variegation. Biopsy indicated to rule out melanoma."

---

## Destruction Medical Necessity

### Premalignant Lesions (AKs) - 17000 Series

**Required documentation:**
- Lesion identification as actinic keratosis
- Number of lesions treated
- Locations
- Treatment method

**Supporting medical necessity:**
- AKs are premalignant
- Risk of progression to SCC
- Destruction is standard treatment

**Example:**
> "Twelve actinic keratoses identified on sun-damaged scalp and face. Destruction with cryotherapy indicated to prevent progression to squamous cell carcinoma."

### Benign Lesions - 17110/17111

**Required documentation:**
- Clinical diagnosis (wart, molluscum, SK, etc.)
- Medical reason for treatment:
  - Symptomatic (pain, irritation, bleeding)
  - Functional impairment
  - Diagnostic uncertainty
  - Risk of spread (warts, molluscum)

**Key:** Must have medical indication, not purely cosmetic

**Acceptable indications:**
- "Wart causing pain with ambulation"
- "Seborrheic keratosis catches on clothing, causes irritation"
- "Molluscum - destruction to prevent spread"
- "Patient concerned about recent changes in lesion"

**Insufficient documentation:**
- "Patient wants it removed" (no medical indication)
- "Cosmetic removal" (not covered)

---

## Excision Medical Necessity

### Benign Excisions (114xx)

**Requires medical indication:**
- Symptomatic lesion
- Functional impairment
- Growth/change concerning for malignancy
- Recurrent inflammation/infection
- Diagnostic necessity

**Document the medical reason:**
> "Epidermal inclusion cyst of posterior neck, 1.5cm, recurrently inflamed and symptomatic. Excision indicated to prevent further infection."

### Malignant Excisions (116xx)

**Path must confirm malignancy** for this code series

**If clinical suspicion but no path yet:** Bill benign code, re-bill malignant when path confirms

**Documentation:**
- Clinical description suggesting malignancy
- Path report confirming diagnosis
- Margins appropriate for lesion type

---

## Repair Medical Necessity

### Simple Repair
- Included with many procedures
- Separately billable only when not bundled

### Intermediate Repair
**Must document:**
- Layered closure OR
- Undermining required to close

**Example:**
> "Wound required undermining to reduce tension. Layered closure with deep dermal 4-0 Vicryl and superficial 5-0 Prolene."

### Complex Repair
**Must document complexity factors:**
- Wound edge debridement
- Scar revision
- Extensive undermining with tissue rearrangement
- Retention sutures
- Stent placement

**Example:**
> "Wound edges required debridement of devitalized tissue. Extensive undermining with tissue advancement necessary. Complex closure with layered technique."

---

## Flap Medical Necessity

### Documentation Requirements

1. **Defect size** that cannot be closed primarily
2. **Flap necessity** - explain why primary closure or graft not appropriate
3. **Type of flap** and design rationale
4. **Both defects measured** - primary and secondary

**Example:**
> "Post-Mohs defect of nasal sidewall, 2.0 × 1.5cm. Location over cartilage and lack of tissue mobility preclude primary closure. Advancement flap designed to optimize aesthetic outcome while maintaining nasal function."

---

## Injection Medical Necessity

### IL Corticosteroid (11900/11901)

**Medical indications:**
- Keloid/hypertrophic scar
- Alopecia areata
- Inflammatory cyst (acne)
- Granuloma annulare

---

## Common Medical Necessity Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| No diagnosis documented | Always include working diagnosis |
| "Cosmetic" as only indication | Must have medical reason |
| Missing size/count | Document measurements |
| Symptom without clinical correlation | Explain why procedure addresses symptom |
| Template-only documentation | Customize to specific patient |
| Missing "why" for procedure | Explain clinical reasoning |

---

## Red Flags for Audit

- Very high volume of same code (cloning)
- Unusual combinations of services
- High-level codes without supporting documentation
- Missing pathology for malignant excisions
- Destruction without lesion counts
- E/M on every procedure visit
- Procedures without diagnoses

---
