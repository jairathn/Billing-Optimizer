# Measurement Rules for Dermatology Procedures

## Overview

Correct measurement is the single most impactful factor in accurate dermatology billing. This document provides comprehensive guidance on measuring all procedure types.

## Section 1: Excision Measurements

### The Fundamental Formula

```
EXCISED DIAMETER = Lesion Diameter + (2 × Narrowest Margin)
```

This is the **most commonly underbilled measurement** in dermatology.

### Step-by-Step Excision Measurement

1. **Measure the lesion** at its widest diameter (before excision)
2. **Determine planned margins** based on lesion type
3. **Calculate excised diameter**: Lesion + (2 × margin)
4. **Document both** lesion size AND margins taken
5. **Confirm with specimen** measurement if possible

### Standard Margin Guidelines

| Lesion Type | Typical Margin | Margin Addition |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Benign lesion | 1-2mm | +2-4mm |
| Actinic keratosis (excision) | 2-3mm | +4-6mm |
| BCC (standard) | 4mm | +8mm |
| SCC in situ | 4-5mm | +8-10mm |
| Invasive SCC | 4-6mm | +8-12mm |
| Melanoma in situ | 5mm | +10mm |
| Melanoma ≤1mm | 1cm | +20mm |
| Melanoma >1mm | 2cm | +40mm |

### Excision Size Calculation Examples

| Lesion | Type | Margin | Excised Diameter | Size Category |
|--------|------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| 3mm | Benign | 1mm | 3+2=5mm=0.5cm | ≤0.5cm |
| 4mm | Benign | 2mm | 4+4=8mm=0.8cm | 0.6-1.0cm |
| 5mm | Benign | 2mm | 5+4=9mm=0.9cm | 0.6-1.0cm |
| 6mm | Benign | 2mm | 6+4=10mm=1.0cm | 0.6-1.0cm |
| 7mm | Benign | 2mm | 7+4=11mm=1.1cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 3mm | BCC | 4mm | 3+8=11mm=1.1cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 5mm | BCC | 4mm | 5+8=13mm=1.3cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 8mm | BCC | 4mm | 8+8=16mm=1.6cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 10mm | BCC | 4mm | 10+8=18mm=1.8cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 12mm | BCC | 4mm | 12+8=20mm=2.0cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 14mm | BCC | 4mm | 14+8=22mm=2.2cm | 2.1-3.0cm |
| 10mm | MIS | 5mm | 10+10=20mm=2.0cm | 1.1-2.0cm |
| 15mm | MIS | 5mm | 15+10=25mm=2.5cm | 2.1-3.0cm |

### Documentation for Excisions

**Required documentation:**
- Lesion location (specific anatomic site)
- Lesion clinical description
- Lesion size (diameter or dimensions)
- Margins planned/taken
- Excised specimen size OR calculated excised diameter
- Closure type

**Example documentation:**
> "Pigmented lesion of the right cheek measuring 6mm in diameter was excised with 2mm margins circumferentially. Excised specimen diameter: 10mm (1.0cm). Layered closure performed."

---

## Section 2: Repair Measurements

### Key Principle

**Measure the SUTURED LENGTH, not the original defect.**

### What to Include in Repair Length

| Include | Exclude |
|---------|---------|
| Total sutured wound length | Original defect size |
| Dog ear repairs | Undermining distance |
| M-plasty extensions | Tissue that wasn't sutured |
| Crescentic extensions | |
| Any additional length from wound revision | |

### Repair Measurement Examples

| Defect | Final Closure | Document |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| 1.5cm circular defect | 2.0cm ellipse | "2.0cm sutured length" |
| 1.0cm square defect | 2.5cm with dog ears | "2.5cm including dog ear repairs" |
| 1.2cm defect, M-plasty | 2.2cm total | "2.2cm with M-plasty conversion" |

### Repair Type Determination

**Simple Repair (12001-12018):**
- Single layer closure
- Epidermis only
- NO undermining
- Includes local anesthesia

**Intermediate Repair (12031-12057):**
- Layered closure (deep + superficial sutures)
- Single layer closure WITH significant undermining
- Includes limited wound preparation

**Triggers for intermediate:**
- ANY buried/deep dermal sutures
- ANY undermining
- "Layered closure"
- "Deep sutures placed"

**Complex Repair (13100-13160):**
- More than layered closure required
- Scar revision
- Debridement of wound edges
- Extensive undermining WITH tissue rearrangement
- Retention sutures
- Stents

**Triggers for complex:**
- "Wound edges debrided"
- "Scar revision performed"
- "Extensive undermining with tissue advancement"
- "Retention sutures placed"
- "Wound required reconstruction"

### Documentation for Repairs

**Simple repair:**
> "Wound closed with interrupted [suture type]. Sutured length: 2.0cm."

**Intermediate repair:**
> "Wound closed in layers. Undermining performed to reduce tension. Deep dermal sutures placed with [suture type]. Epidermis closed with [suture type]. Final sutured wound length: 3.5cm."

**Complex repair:**
> "Wound edges required debridement of devitalized tissue. Extensive undermining with tissue advancement performed. Layered closure with deep dermal and superficial sutures. Final sutured wound length: 4.0cm."

## Section 3: Flap Measurements

### The Critical Rule

```
TOTAL FLAP SIZE = Primary Defect + Secondary Defect
```

**This is the #1 most underbilled measurement in dermatology surgery.**

### Understanding Primary vs Secondary Defects

**Primary Defect:** The original wound (e.g., Mohs defect, excision site)

**Secondary Defect:** The additional defect created by moving tissue (where the flap came from)

### Flap Measurement Examples

| Primary Defect | Secondary Defect | Total Size | Code |
|----------------|------------------|------------|------|
| 1.5 × 1.5cm = 2.25 sq cm | 2.0 × 1.5cm = 3.0 sq cm | 5.25 sq cm | ≤10 sq cm |
| 2.0 × 2.0cm = 4.0 sq cm | 3.0 × 2.0cm = 6.0 sq cm | 10.0 sq cm | ≤10 sq cm |
| 2.0 × 2.0cm = 4.0 sq cm | 3.5 × 2.0cm = 7.0 sq cm | 11.0 sq cm | 10.1-30 sq cm |
| 3.0 × 3.0cm = 9.0 sq cm | 4.0 × 2.0cm = 8.0 sq cm | 17.0 sq cm | 10.1-30 sq cm |

### Types of Flaps and Measurement

**Rotation Flap:**
- Primary: Original defect
- Secondary: Donor site defect at base of rotation

**Advancement Flap:**
- Primary: Original defect
- Secondary: Defect created by advancing tissue (often at sides)

**Transposition Flap:**
- Primary: Original defect
- Secondary: Donor site where flap was raised

**Bilobed Flap:**
- Primary: Original defect
- Secondary: BOTH lobes create secondary defects

**Rhombic Flap:**
- Primary: Rhomboid-shaped defect
- Secondary: Donor site

### Flap Documentation

**Required elements:**
- Primary defect size (dimensions AND square cm)
- Type of flap
- Secondary defect size (dimensions AND square cm)
- Total combined defect size
- Anatomic location

**Example documentation:**
> "Nasal sidewall defect after Mohs measuring 1.5 × 1.5cm (2.25 sq cm). Rotation flap designed from adjacent nasal tissue. Secondary defect at flap donor site: 2.0 × 1.5cm (3.0 sq cm). Total defect for flap: 5.25 sq cm. Layered closure of secondary defect."

## Section 4: Graft Measurements

### Full-Thickness Skin Graft (FTSG)

**Measure:** Recipient site in square centimeters

**Key points:**
- Measure the defect being grafted
- Donor site repair is separately billable
- Document both recipient and donor sites

### Split-Thickness Skin Graft (STSG)

**Measure:** Recipient site in square centimeters

**Key points:**
- Measure defect receiving graft
- Donor site not separately billable
- May bill for skin preparation codes

### Graft Documentation

> "FTSG harvested from [donor site] measuring [X × Y cm]. Graft inset into [recipient site] defect measuring [A × B cm] = [Z sq cm]. Donor site closed primarily with layered closure, sutured length [length]."

## Section 5: Destruction Measurements

### Counting Lesions

**Actinic Keratoses (17000-17004):**
- Count each individual lesion treated
- Each physically separate AK = 1 lesion
- Confluent AKs in field treatment = count visible discrete lesions

**Benign Lesions (17110-17111):**
- Count each lesion treated
- Warts: each discrete wart = 1
- Molluscum: each lesion = 1
- SKs, DPNs, etc.: count each

### Destruction Counting Rules

| Scenario | How to Count |
|----------|--------------|
| 3 AKs on right hand | 3 lesions |
| Field treatment, 8 visible AKs | 8 lesions |
| 5 warts on one foot | 5 lesions |
| Periungual wart, extensive | 1 lesion |
| Multiple molluscum | Count each papule |
| Clustered warts on finger | Count each discrete wart |

### Documentation for Destruction

> "12 actinic keratoses treated with cryotherapy: 4 on right dorsal hand, 3 on left dorsal hand, 2 on right forearm, 3 on right temple."

---

## Section 6: Biopsy Measurements

### When Size Matters

**Shave biopsy (11102-11107):** Size not required for coding, but document for completeness

**Punch biopsy (11104-11107):** Document punch size (3mm, 4mm, etc.)

**Incisional biopsy (11106-11107):** Document specimen dimensions

### Counting Biopsies

- Each separate biopsy = 1 count
- Use primary code for first + add-on for additional
- Different techniques = different primary codes

| Biopsies Performed | Coding |
|--------------------|--------|
| 2 shave biopsies | 11102 + 11103 |
| 3 shave biopsies | 11102 + 11103 + 11103 |
| 1 shave + 1 punch | 11102 + 11104 |
| 2 punch biopsies | 11104 + 11105 |
| 1 incisional + 1 shave | 11106 + 11102 |

## Section 7: Mohs Measurements

### Block Counting

Each tissue block = 1 count

**What constitutes a block:**
- Each section of tissue processed separately
- Multiple pieces from same stage = multiple blocks
- Large circumference may require multiple blocks

### Stage Counting

Each stage = 1 count

**Each stage includes:**
- Tissue removal
- Mapping
- Processing
- Microscopic examination
- Analysis of margins

### Mohs Documentation Requirements

| Element | Document |
|---------|----------|
| Tumor location | Specific anatomic site |
| Tumor size | Pre-operative dimensions |
| Each stage | Stage number, blocks taken |
| Margin status | Clear or positive for each stage |
| Final defect | Dimensions |
| Reconstruction | Separately documented |

---

## Section 8: Injection Measurements

### Intralesional Injection (11900-11901)

**Count:** Number of lesions injected

| Lesion Count | Code |
|--------------|------|
| 1-7 lesions | 11900 |
| 8+ lesions | 11901 |

### What Counts as a Lesion

- Each discrete keloid = 1
- Each acne cyst = 1
- Each alopecia areata patch = 1
- Multiple injection sites in ONE large lesion = 1 lesion
- Each physically separate lesion = 1 count

### Documentation for Injections

> "Intralesional triamcinolone 10mg/mL injected into 5 lesions: 2 keloids on chest, 1 hypertrophic scar on shoulder, 2 alopecia areata patches on scalp. Total volume: 1.5mL."

---

## Section 9: Debridement Measurements

### Wound Debridement (11042-11047)

**Measure:** Surface area in square centimeters

**Depth determines code:**
- 11042: Subcutaneous tissue
- 11043: Muscle and/or fascia
- 11044: Bone

### Size Thresholds

| Size | Coding |
|------|--------|
| ≤20 sq cm | Primary code only |
| 21-40 sq cm | Primary + add-on × 1 |
| 41-60 sq cm | Primary + add-on × 2 |

### Debridement Documentation

> "Chronic wound right lower leg, 4.0 × 3.5cm = 14 sq cm. Sharp debridement performed to subcutaneous tissue level. Necrotic tissue and biofilm removed."

---

## Section 10: Common Measurement Errors

### Excision Errors

| Error | Correct Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| Measuring only lesion, not margins | Include margins in excised diameter |
| Using defect size for excision code | Use excised specimen diameter |
| Not documenting margins | Always document planned margins |
| Rounding down | Round to nearest 0.1cm |

### Repair Errors

| Error | Correct Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| Using defect size for repair | Measure sutured wound length |
| Not including dog ears | Include all sutured length |
| Calling intermediate "simple" | Any undermining or layers = intermediate |
| Not documenting technique | Specify undermining, layers |

### Flap Errors

| Error | Correct Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| Only measuring primary defect | MUST include secondary defect |
| Measuring in linear cm | Flaps measured in square cm |
| Not documenting flap type | Specify advancement/rotation/transposition |
