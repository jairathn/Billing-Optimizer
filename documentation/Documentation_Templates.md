## Procedure Documentation

### Biopsy

**Shave (11102):**
> "Shave biopsy of [lesion description] at [location]. Indication: [rule out malignancy/diagnose rash/etc]. Hemostasis achieved with [method]. Specimen submitted to pathology."

**Punch (11104):**
> "Punch biopsy, [size]mm, of [location]. Indication: [need full-thickness specimen/inflammatory dermatosis workup/etc]. Site closed with [suture type] OR left to heal by secondary intention."

**Incisional (11106):**
> "Incisional biopsy of [location]. Indication: [large lesion requiring partial sampling/deep tissue needed]. Specimen [dimensions] submitted. Layered closure performed."

### Destruction - AKs

> "[Number] actinic keratoses treated with cryotherapy at the following locations: [list specific sites with counts]. Example: 4 on right dorsal hand, 3 on left dorsal hand, 2 on forehead."

### Destruction - Benign

> "[Number] [lesion type: warts/molluscum/seborrheic keratoses] destroyed with [cryotherapy/electrodesiccation] at [locations]. Medical indication: [symptoms/functional impairment/diagnostic uncertainty]."

### Excision

> "[Lesion type] of [location] measuring [lesion size]. Excised with [margin]mm clinical margins. Excised specimen diameter: [calculated: lesion + 2×margin]. [Simple/Intermediate/Complex] closure performed. [If intermediate+: describe technique]. Final sutured wound length: [X]cm."

### Repair - Intermediate

> "Wound closed in layers. Undermining performed to reduce tension. Deep dermal sutures placed with [suture type]. Epidermis approximated with [suture type]. Final sutured wound length: [X]cm."

### Repair - Complex

> "Wound required complex closure. [Wound edges debrided of devitalized tissue / Scar revision performed / Extensive undermining with tissue advancement required]. [Retention sutures placed / Stent used]. Layered closure with [technique]. Final sutured wound length: [X]cm."

### Flap

> "Defect at [location] measuring [X × Y]cm = [Z] sq cm (primary defect). Primary closure not feasible due to [size/location/tension/cosmetic considerations]. [Advancement/Rotation/Transposition] flap designed. Secondary defect at donor site: [A × B]cm = [C] sq cm. Total flap defect: [Z + C] sq cm. Flap inset with layered closure. Donor site closed [technique]."

### I&D

**Simple (10060):**
> "Fluctuant abscess of [location] measuring approximately [size]. Incision made after local anesthesia. Purulent material expressed. Wound irrigated. [Packed with iodoform/Left open to drain]."

**Complicated (10061):**
> "[Large/Multiple] [abscess(es)] of [location], [size]. After local anesthesia, incision made. Copious purulent material expressed. [Loculations broken up / Multiple pockets drained / Deep cavity explored]. Wound thoroughly irrigated and packed. Extensive involvement required prolonged drainage."

### IL Injection

> "Intralesional [triamcinolone/5-FU/bleomycin] [concentration] injected into [number] [lesion type] at [locations]. Total volume: [X]mL. Indication: [keloid/inflammatory nodule/wart/alopecia areata]."

### Nail Debridement

> "Debridement of [number] dystrophic nails. Diagnosis: [onychomycosis/psoriatic nails]. Nails reduced with [rotary burr/nail clippers] due to [thickness/debris/dystrophy]. [For Medicare: Professional care required due to patient's [diabetes/PVD/neuropathy] and risk of injury with self-care.]"

---

## Medical Necessity Language

### For Benign Lesion Removal

> "Patient reports [lesion] is symptomatic with [pain/irritation/bleeding/catching on clothing]. Removal indicated for symptom relief and functional improvement."

### For Chemical Peel

> "Chemical peel with [agent] indicated for treatment of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation secondary to [acne/inflammatory dermatosis]. This is a medical treatment, not cosmetic."

### For Destruction of SKs

> "Seborrheic keratosis causing [irritation/bleeding with minor trauma/cosmetic concern affecting patient's daily function]. Patient requests removal. Medical necessity established."

## Complexity Factor Documentation

### For Upgrading Simple → Intermediate Repair

Add one of:
- "Undermining performed to reduce wound tension"
- "Layered closure with deep dermal sutures"
- "Buried absorbable sutures placed in deep dermis"
- "Two-layer closure technique"

### For Upgrading Intermediate → Complex Repair

Add one or more of:
- "Wound edges required debridement of devitalized tissue"
- "Scar revision necessary for adequate closure"
- "Extensive undermining with tissue advancement performed"
- "Retention sutures placed due to tension"
- "Wound required reconstruction beyond standard layered closure"

## Templates for Common Missed Opportunities

### Documenting Multiple Conditions
> "Today's visit addressed multiple conditions: 1) [Primary condition] with [status]. 2) [Secondary condition] with [status]. Separate treatment plans for each."

## Time-Based Billing Support
