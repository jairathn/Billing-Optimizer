# Audit Defense Strategies

## Overview
Proper documentation is the best audit defense. This guide outlines strategies for supporting your billing.

## Pre-Audit Prevention

### Documentation Principles
1. **Document in real-time** - Notes at time of service are most credible
2. **Be specific** - Measurements, counts, locations, technique
3. **Medical necessity** - State WHY for every procedure
4. **Customized notes** - Avoid templated/cloned documentation

### Key Elements by Procedure Type

#### E/M Defense
- Number and complexity of problems documented
- Data reviewed specified (labs, imaging, records)
- Risk level justified (Rx requiring monitoring, procedure complexity)
- If time-based: total time and counseling topics

#### Procedure Defense
- Indication/medical necessity stated
- Technique described
- Measurements documented
- Outcome noted

## Audit Response Strategy

### When Audited

1. **Don't panic** - Most audits are routine
2. **Review records** - Understand what was billed and documented
3. **Gather supporting info** - Path reports, photos, additional records
4. **Respond timely** - Meet all deadlines
5. **Be factual** - Don't embellish or create new documentation

### Supporting Documentation

| Code Type | Supporting Evidence |
|-----------|---------------------|
| E/M | Complete note with MDM elements |
| Biopsy | Path report, clinical indication |
| Excision | Measurements, margins, path report |
| Destruction | Lesion count, locations, photos if available |
| Repair | Technique, length, complexity factors |
| Flap | Both defect measurements, flap type |
| Mohs | Stage count, block count, tumor map, path |

## High-Risk Code Defense

### Modifier -25 Defense
Document:
- Separate chief complaint OR
- Separate condition addressed OR
- Significant work beyond procedure decision
- E/M note that stands alone

### Complex Repair Defense
Document at least one:
- Wound edge debridement
- Scar revision
- Extensive undermining with tissue rearrangement
- Retention sutures
- Stent placement

### Flap Defense
Document:
- Why primary closure not feasible
- Primary defect size (sq cm)
- Secondary defect size (sq cm)
- Flap type and design rationale
- Total combined defect

### High E/M Defense
For 99214:
- Multiple chronic conditions (2+) OR
- Mild exacerbation of chronic condition OR
- Prescription requiring monitoring OR
- Moderate data review

For 99215:
- Severe exacerbation OR
- Drug requiring intensive monitoring OR
- Threat to life/bodily function OR
- Decision about hospitalization

## Common Audit Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Defense |
|---------------|---------|
| High -25 usage | Ensure E/M documentation is separate and substantial |
| High procedure volume | Each procedure documented with individual indication |
| Consistent high-level codes | MDM documentation supports each level |
| Unusual code combinations | Each procedure has separate indication |
| Same codes every visit | Documentation shows different clinical scenarios |

---

## Addendum Policy

### When Appropriate
- Clarifying existing documentation
- Adding information available at time of service
- Correcting errors

### When NOT Appropriate
- Creating new information after audit
- Changing clinical findings
- Adding significant content not originally documented

### Addendum Format
> "Addendum [date]: [clarification]. This information was available at time of original encounter on [service date]."

## Working with Compliance

### Best Practices
1. Regular internal audits
2. Education on documentation requirements
3. Query system for coding questions
4. Feedback loop for identified issues
5. Clear policies on addenda and corrections

### When to Involve Compliance
- Any government audit (Medicare, Medicaid)
- Large-scale recoupment requests
- Allegations of fraud
- Patterns suggesting documentation issues
