# Documentation Red Flags - Audit Triggers to Avoid

## Overview
These patterns trigger audits or denials. Avoid them through proper documentation.

## E/M Red Flags

### Over-Use of High-Level Codes
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| 99215 on every complex patient | Reserve for true high MDM (threat to function, high-risk drugs) |
| 99214 without MDM support | Document: multiple conditions, drug monitoring, or data review |
| -25 on every procedure visit | Only use when E/M is truly separate, significant work |

### G2211 Misuse
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| G2211 on new patients | Generally not appropriate unless establishing chronic care |
| G2211 without chronic condition | Document specific chronic condition being managed |
| G2211 on every visit regardless | Ensure ongoing management documented |

## Procedure Red Flags

### Biopsy Issues
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| No indication documented | State clinical reason for biopsy |
| Multiple biopsies same site | Each must be separate lesion |
| Biopsy + excision same lesion same day | Bill only excision |

### Destruction Issues
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| AK counts without locations | Document count AND locations |
| Benign destruction without medical necessity | Document symptoms/indication |
| Same lesion counts every visit | Must be new/different lesions |

### Excision Issues
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| No margins documented | Always document margins taken |
| Size without measurement | Measure and document precisely |
| Malignant code without path | Path must confirm malignancy |

### Repair Issues
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Complex without complexity factors | Document: debridement, scar revision, extensive undermining |
| Intermediate without technique | Document: undermining OR layered closure |
| Repair length > reasonable for defect | Measure sutured wound, include dog ears |

### Flap Issues
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Only primary defect measured | MUST include secondary defect |
| Flap for small defect closed primarily | Document why flap necessary |
| Repair code with flap | Flap includes repair of both defects |

## Pattern Red Flags

### Cloning Indicators
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Identical notes for different patients | Customize each note |
| Same procedures on every visit | Vary based on clinical need |
| Same E/M level regardless of complexity | Level should match actual MDM |

### Unusual Combinations
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Multiple high-paying procedures same day | Document necessity for each |
| E/M + many procedures every visit | Ensure each is medically necessary |
| Services that don't match diagnosis | Verify diagnosis supports services |

---

## Modifier Red Flags

### -25 Overuse
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| -25 on >50% of E/M visits | Review if truly separate work |
| -25 without separate documentation | E/M note must stand alone |
| -25 for brief pre-procedure assessment | This is included in procedure |

### -59/X Modifier Overuse
| Red Flag | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| -59 on bundled services routinely | Verify services are truly distinct |
| Multiple -59 modifiers same claim | Ensure legitimate separation |

---

## Documentation Deficiencies

### Missing Elements
| Missing | Required |
|---------|----------|
| Medical necessity | Document indication for every procedure |
| Measurements | Size for excisions, repairs, flaps |
| Lesion counts | Number for destruction codes |
| Technique details | Closure type, complexity factors |
| Location specificity | Exact anatomic site |

### Vague Documentation
| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Lesion removed" | "1.2cm seborrheic keratosis of mid-back excised with 2mm margins" |
| "Closure performed" | "Layered closure with 4-0 Vicryl deep dermal and 5-0 Prolene epidermal" |
| "Multiple AKs treated" | "8 AKs treated: 3 on scalp, 2 on right cheek, 3 on left dorsal hand" |

## Quick Self-Audit Checklist

Before submitting claim:
- [ ] E/M level matches documented MDM?
- [ ] -25 only if separate, significant E/M work?
- [ ] All procedures have documented indication?
- [ ] Measurements documented for size-dependent codes?
- [ ] Lesion counts documented for destruction?
- [ ] Complexity factors documented if complex repair?
- [ ] Both defects measured for flaps?
- [ ] Path confirms diagnosis for malignant codes?
