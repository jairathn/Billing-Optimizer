## E/M Level
| Scenario | E/M | Justification |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Single site, stable | 99213 | Chronic stable |
| Multiple sites | 99213-99214 | Multiple areas |
| Psoriasis overlap | 99214 | Multiple conditions |

## G2211: Always Add
Chronic condition requiring ongoing management. +0.33 wRVU.

## Comorbidities

| Finding | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Psoriasis overlap ("sebopsoriasis") | Bill for both conditions |
| Scalp + face + chest | Multiple sites increases MDM |
| Resistant thick plaques | IL injection (11900) |
| Tinea differential | KOH prep |
| Rosacea overlap | Second diagnosis |

---

## Billing Examples

### Standard Follow-up
- 99213 + G2211 = 1.63 wRVU

### With Psoriasis Overlap
- 99214 + G2211 = 2.25 wRVU

### With IL Injection of Thick Plaques
- 99213-25 + 11900 + G2211 = 2.14 wRVU

---

## "Next Time" Points
- Look for psoriasis overlap → second diagnosis
- Check all sites (scalp, face, chest, ears)
- IL injection for resistant plaques
- Always add G2211
