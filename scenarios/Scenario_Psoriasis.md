# Clinical Scenario: Psoriasis Visit

## Overview

Psoriasis visits offer extensive billing opportunities due to the chronic nature, multiple affected sites, potential systemic involvement, and range of treatments. This is a high-value encounter type.

## Baseline Billing

### E/M Level Determination

| Scenario | E/M Level | MDM Justification |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Stable on topicals | 99213 | Low: Chronic stable, topical Rx |
| Flare, adjusting Rx | 99214 | Moderate: Mild exacerbation, Rx management |
| Biologics discussion/management | 99214 | Moderate: Drug requiring monitoring |
| Severe flare, multiple sites | 99214-99215 | Moderate-High: Significant exacerbation |
| Erythrodermic psoriasis | 99215 | High: Threat to bodily function |

### G2211: ALWAYS Add

Psoriasis is the quintessential chronic condition. Add G2211 to EVERY established patient visit.

**wRVU:** +0.33 per visit

---

## Procedure Opportunities

### IL Injection for Thick Plaques (11900/11901)

**Indication:** Resistant, thick plaques not responding to topicals

**wRVU:** 0.51 (≤7 lesions) / 0.78 (>7 lesions)

**Documentation:**
> "Thick, resistant psoriatic plaques on bilateral elbows injected with triamcinolone 10mg/mL, 0.1mL per lesion. 4 lesions injected."

### Nail Debridement (11720/11721)

**Indication:** Psoriatic nail dystrophy with debris/thickening

**wRVU:** 0.31 (1-5 nails) / 0.53 (6+ nails)

**Documentation:**
> "Psoriatic nail dystrophy with onycholysis and subungual debris. 8 dystrophic nails debrided."

### Scalp AK Destruction (if present)

**Opportunity:** Psoriasis patients often have sun-damaged scalps. Check for AKs.

## Comorbidities to Look For

### Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)

**Screen for:**
- Morning stiffness >30 minutes
- Joint pain, especially fingers/toes (dactylitis)
- Heel pain (enthesitis)
- Low back pain

**Opportunity:**
- Higher MDM (moderate→high if significant)
- Rheumatology referral (care coordination)
- May affect treatment selection

**Ask:** "Do you have any joint pain or stiffness, especially in the morning?"

### Nail Involvement

**Finding:** Pitting, onycholysis, oil spots, subungual hyperkeratosis

**Opportunity:**
- Document increases complexity
- Nail debridement billable
- Indicates higher disease burden

### Scalp Involvement

**Finding:** Thick plaques, scale, erythema

**Opportunity:**
- Document as additional site
- May warrant separate prescription
- Increases complexity

### Inverse Psoriasis

**Finding:** Smooth, red plaques in intertriginous areas

**Opportunity:**
- Document as additional variant
- Separate treatment considerations
- Increases complexity

### Cardiovascular Risk

**Opportunity:**
- Document metabolic screening
- Higher MDM for chronic care
- Patient counseling

### Depression/Quality of Life

**Opportunity:**
- Document impact on patient
- Increases MDM complexity
- May support higher-level visit

## Visit Optimization Checklist

### Before the Visit
- [ ] Review current treatments
- [ ] Check if on biologic (monitoring required)
- [ ] Review labs if applicable

### During Exam
- [ ] Calculate BSA involvement
- [ ] Check ALL sites: scalp, nails, ears, umbilicus, intergluteal, inverse areas
- [ ] Look for thick resistant plaques → IL injection opportunity
- [ ] Assess nail dystrophy → debridement opportunity
- [ ] Screen for PsA symptoms
- [ ] Document impact on quality of life

### At Checkout
- [ ] Ensure G2211 added
- [ ] -25 on E/M if procedures performed
- [ ] All procedures coded

## Billing Examples

### Example 1: Stable Psoriasis Follow-up

**Visit:** Stable on current regimen, refills needed

**Billing:**
- 99213 (chronic stable)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.30 + 0.33 = 1.63

### Example 2: Psoriasis with Nail Disease

**Visit:** Psoriasis plus nail involvement, 8 nails debrided

**Billing:**
- 99214-25 (psoriasis + nail disease = multiple conditions)
- 11721 (debridement 6+ nails)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 0.53 + 0.33 = 2.78

### Example 3: Psoriasis Flare with IL Injection

**Visit:** Mild flare, 5 thick plaques injected

**Billing:**
- 99214-25 (mild exacerbation)
- 11900 (IL injection ≤7 lesions)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 0.51 + 0.33 = 2.76

### Example 4: Complex Psoriasis Management

**Visit:** On biologic, joint symptoms, multiple sites, nail disease

**Billing:**
- 99215-25 (drug monitoring, multiple sites, PsA concern)
- 11721 (nail debridement if performed)
- 11900 (IL injection if performed)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 2.80 + 0.53 + 0.51 + 0.33 = 4.17

### Example 5: Biologic Initiation Discussion

**Visit:** Discussing starting biologic therapy

**Billing:**
- 99214 (moderate risk drug discussion)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 0.33 = 2.25

## Documentation Templates

### Standard Psoriasis Visit
> "Follow-up for plaque psoriasis. Current treatment: [medications]. BSA involved: approximately [X]%. Locations: [list sites]. Nail involvement: [yes/no, describe]. Joint symptoms: [screened, negative/positive with description]. Current disease status: [stable/improving/worsening]. Continue current regimen with [modifications]. Return in [timeframe]."

### With PsA Screening
> "Screened for psoriatic arthritis. Patient [denies/reports] morning stiffness, joint pain, or swelling. [If positive: Duration [X] minutes, affecting [joints]. Rheumatology referral placed.]"

### With IL Injection
> "Thick, treatment-resistant plaques identified at [locations]. Intralesional triamcinolone [concentration] injected into [number] lesions. Total volume: [X]mL."

### With Nail Debridement
> "Psoriatic nail dystrophy affecting [number] nails with [describe: pitting, onycholysis, debris]. Nail debridement performed."

---

## "Next Time" Teaching Points

### If nails not assessed:
> "For future visits: Always examine nails in psoriasis patients. 50% have nail involvement. Dystrophic nails can be debrided (11720/11721, 0.31-0.53 wRVU)."

### If PsA not screened:
> "For future visits: Screen for psoriatic arthritis at each visit. Positive screen increases MDM and may support 99215. Document: morning stiffness duration, joint pain, swelling."

### If resistant plaques not injected:
> "For future visits: Thick, resistant plaques can be injected with IL steroid (11900, 0.51 wRVU). Particularly effective for elbows, knees."

### If G2211 not added:
> "For future visits: Psoriasis is chronic. Add G2211 (+0.33 wRVU) to every established visit."
