# Clinical Scenario: Vitiligo Visit

## Overview

Vitiligo is a chronic condition requiring ongoing management with opportunities for phototherapy billing and G2211.

---

## E/M Level

| Scenario | E/M | Justification |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Stable, topical treatment | 99213 | Chronic stable |
| Progression, treatment change | 99214 | Mild exacerbation, Rx adjustment |
| Phototherapy management | 99213-99214 | Ongoing treatment monitoring |
| Systemic therapy consideration | 99214 | Drug management discussion |

## G2211: Always Add

Vitiligo is a chronic condition. Add G2211 to every established visit.

**wRVU:** +0.33 per visit

---

## Treatment Opportunities

### Phototherapy (96900)

**Per session billing** for NB-UVB treatment.

| Code | Description | wRVU |
|------|-------------|------|
| 96900 | Actinotherapy (NB-UVB) | 0.26 |

Typical course: 2-3x weekly for months

**Revenue potential:** 50 sessions × 0.26 = 13.0 wRVU

### Excimer Laser
- Targeted phototherapy
- May have different billing depending on setup

---

## Comorbidities to Screen

| Finding | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Thyroid disease | Higher MDM, lab monitoring |
| Other autoimmune conditions | Document, increases complexity |
| Halo nevi | Document, monitor |
| Alopecia areata | Second diagnosis, IL injection |
| Psoriasis | Second diagnosis |

### Thyroid Screening
- TSH at baseline and periodically
- Ordering labs = data element for MDM

---

## Billing Examples

### Standard Vitiligo Follow-up
- 99213 + G2211 = 1.63 wRVU

### Vitiligo with Phototherapy Session
- 96900 = 0.26 wRVU (per session)

### Vitiligo with Thyroid Workup
- 99214 + G2211 = 2.25 wRVU

### E/M + Phototherapy Same Day
- 99213-25 + G2211 + 96900 = 1.89 wRVU

## "Next Time" Points

- **G2211 on every visit** - vitiligo is chronic (+0.33 wRVU)
- Phototherapy: bill every session (96900, 0.26 wRVU each)
- Screen for thyroid disease → labs = MDM data element
- Look for associated alopecia areata → IL injection opportunity
- Document extent (BSA) for tracking
