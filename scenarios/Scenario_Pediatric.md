# Clinical Scenario: Pediatric Dermatology

## Overview
Pediatric visits have specific considerations for common conditions and parent counseling.

---

## Common Pediatric Conditions

### Molluscum Contagiosum
- Destruction: 17110 (1-14 lesions) / 17111 (15+)
- Count every lesion
- wRVU: 0.52 / 0.79

### Warts
- Destruction: 17110/17111
- Same coding as adults
- May need multiple sessions

### Atopic Dermatitis
- E/M + G2211 for chronic
- Look for secondary infection
- Parent counseling adds complexity

### Infantile Hemangiomas
- Higher MDM if treatment needed
- Propranolol = drug monitoring

### Tinea
- Diagnosis, treatment
- KOH prep if needed

---

## E/M Considerations

### Parent as Historian
- Document: "History obtained from parent"
- Independent historian adds to MDM data

### Counseling Time
- Parent education = counseling
- If >50% time counseling, document for time-based billing

### G2211
- Applicable for chronic pediatric conditions (eczema, ongoing management)

---

## Billing Examples

### Molluscum Treatment (12 lesions)
- 99213-25 + 17110 = 1.82 wRVU

### Eczema with Infection
- 99214 + G2211 = 2.25 wRVU

### Warts (20 lesions)
- 99213-25 + 17111 = 2.09 wRVU

---

## "Next Time" Points
- COUNT all molluscum/warts for proper coding
- Document parent counseling time
- Note "history from parent" for MDM data
- G2211 for chronic conditions
- Look for secondary infection in eczema
