# Clinical Scenario: Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)

## Overview

HS visits are high-opportunity encounters due to the chronic nature, frequent acute procedures, biologic management, and multiple affected sites. This is one of the highest-value chronic conditions in dermatology.

## Baseline Billing

### E/M Level Determination

| Scenario | E/M Level | MDM Justification |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Stable on topicals only | 99213 | Low: Chronic stable |
| Active disease, antibiotics | 99214 | Moderate: Rx management |
| Biologic management | 99214 | Moderate: Drug requiring monitoring |
| Acute flare with procedure | 99214-25 | Moderate + separate procedure |
| Severe, hospitalization discussed | 99215 | High: Significant morbidity |

### G2211: ALWAYS Add

HS is a chronic condition. Add G2211 to EVERY visit.

**wRVU:** +0.33

## Procedure Opportunities

### I&D of Abscess (10060/10061)

**10060 - Simple I&D**
- Single, small abscess
- wRVU: 1.19

**10061 - Complicated I&D**
- Large abscess
- Multiple abscesses
- Deep/extensive involvement
- Significant packing required
- wRVU: 2.39

**HS abscesses often qualify as 10061!**

**Documentation for 10061:**
> "Large, fluctuant abscess of left axilla measuring 4cm, incised and drained. Extensive loculations broken up. Significant purulent material expressed. Wound packed with iodoform gauze."

### Intralesional Injection (11900/11901)

**Indications:**
- Inflammatory nodules (pre-abscess)
- Keloidal/hypertrophic scarring
- Sinus tracts (injection for reduction)

**wRVU:** 0.51 (≤7 lesions) / 0.78 (>7 lesions)

### Excision of Sinus Tracts

**Codes:** 114xx series (benign) based on excised diameter

**High-value opportunity** - chronic sinus tracts requiring excision can generate significant wRVU.

### Unroofing/Deroofing

**Coding:** Typically 10060/10061 depending on complexity, or excision codes if tissue removed.

## Comorbidities to Look For

### Multiple Affected Sites

**Common sites:**
- Axillae
- Groin
- Inframammary
- Buttocks/perianal
- Under abdominal pannus

**Opportunity:** Multiple sites = higher MDM complexity

**Document each site separately.**

### Obesity/Metabolic Syndrome

**Opportunity:**
- Document BMI
- Increases complexity
- May affect treatment selection
- Patient counseling

### Depression/Anxiety

**Opportunity:**
- HS significantly impacts QOL
- Document psychological impact
- Increases MDM complexity
- May warrant referral (care coordination)

### Secondary Infection

**Opportunity:**
- Bacterial superinfection
- May need culture
- Separate treatment consideration
- Higher MDM

### Scarring/Contractures

**Opportunity:**
- IL injection for keloidal scars
- Document functional impairment
- May warrant surgical planning

## Visit Optimization Checklist

### During Exam
- [ ] Examine ALL typical sites (axillae, groin, inframammary, buttocks)
- [ ] Count and document active nodules/abscesses
- [ ] Assess for draining sinuses
- [ ] Look for keloidal scarring → IL injection opportunity
- [ ] Check for acute abscesses → I&D opportunity
- [ ] Document Hurley stage
- [ ] Document pain level/QOL impact

### Procedures to Consider
- [ ] Any fluctuant abscess → I&D (prefer 10061 if criteria met)
- [ ] Inflammatory nodules → IL injection
- [ ] Keloidal scars → IL injection
- [ ] Chronic sinus tracts → deroofing or excision

### At Checkout
- [ ] G2211 added
- [ ] -25 on E/M if procedures performed
- [ ] All procedures coded with correct complexity

## Billing Examples

### Example 1: HS Follow-up, Stable

**Visit:** Stable on current regimen, no active lesions

**Billing:**
- 99213
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.30 + 0.33 = 1.63

### Example 2: HS with Abscess Drainage

**Visit:** Acute abscess, I&D performed

**Billing:**
- 99214-25 (flare)
- 10061 (complicated I&D - HS abscesses typically complicated)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 2.39 + 0.33 = 4.64

### Example 3: HS with Multiple Procedures

**Visit:** 2 abscesses drained, 5 nodules injected

**Billing:**
- 99214-25
- 10061 (complicated I&D - multiple)
- 11900 (IL injection ≤7 lesions)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 2.39 + 0.51 + 0.33 = 5.15

### Example 4: HS on Biologic

**Visit:** Follow-up on Humira, labs reviewed

**Billing:**
- 99214 (drug requiring monitoring)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 0.33 = 2.25

### Example 5: Sinus Tract Excision

**Visit:** Excision of chronic sinus tract

**Billing:**
- 99214-25
- 11402 (excision benign, 1.1-2.0cm excised diameter typical)
- 12031 (intermediate repair if layered closure)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 1.41 + 1.95 + 0.33 = 5.61

## Documentation Templates

### Standard HS Visit
> "Follow-up for hidradenitis suppurativa, Hurley Stage [I/II/III]. Currently on [medications]. 
>
> Examination:
> - Right axilla: [findings]
> - Left axilla: [findings]
> - Right groin: [findings]
> - Left groin: [findings]
> - Inframammary: [findings]
> - Other sites: [findings]
>
> [Number] active nodules, [number] draining sinuses, [number] abscesses. Scarring: [description]. 
>
> Assessment: HS with [stable/active] disease.
> Plan: [treatments, follow-up]"

### I&D Documentation (10061)
> "Fluctuant abscess of [location] measuring [X]cm. After local anesthesia with [agent], incision made. [Large amount of / Copious] purulent material expressed. [Loculations broken up / Deep cavity explored]. Wound irrigated and packed with [packing material]. Patient instructed on wound care."

### IL Injection
> "Intralesional triamcinolone [concentration] injected into [number] inflammatory nodules/scars at [locations]. Total volume: [X]mL."

## "Next Time" Teaching Points

### If I&D coded as simple (10060):
> "HS abscesses often meet criteria for complicated (10061): large, deep, multiple, or requiring extensive drainage. 10061 = 2.39 vs 1.19 wRVU."

### If nodules not injected:
> "Early inflammatory nodules respond to IL steroid (11900, 0.51 wRVU). May prevent abscess formation."

### If scars not addressed:
> "Keloidal/hypertrophic scars from HS can be injected (11900). Document and treat."

### If all sites not examined:
> "Always examine all HS-prone sites: bilateral axillae, bilateral groin, inframammary, buttocks. Document each."

### If G2211 not added:
> "HS is chronic. Add G2211 (+0.33 wRVU) to every visit."
