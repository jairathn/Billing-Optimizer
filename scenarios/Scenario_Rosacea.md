## Comorbidities to Look For

| Finding | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Ocular rosacea | Higher MDM, ophthalmology referral |
| Rhinophyma | Surgical planning, destruction codes |
| Demodex | Microscopic exam (96902), targeted treatment |
| Seborrheic dermatitis overlap | Second diagnosis |
| Acne component | Second diagnosis |

---

## Procedure Opportunities

### Destruction for Rhinophyma
- Electrosurgery, laser, excision
- Codes: 17000+ series or excision codes depending on technique

### Demodex Evaluation
- Microscopic exam: 96902 (0.40 wRVU)

---

## Billing Examples

### Standard Rosacea Follow-up
- 99213 + G2211 = 1.63 wRVU

### Rosacea with Ocular + Multiple Subtypes
- 99214 + G2211 = 2.25 wRVU

---

## "Next Time" Points
- Ask about eye symptoms → ocular rosacea increases complexity
- Look for seborrheic dermatitis overlap → second diagnosis
- Consider Demodex evaluation if refractory
- Always add G2211 for chronic management
