# Clinical Scenario: Pruritus Visit

## Overview

Pruritus visits require workup consideration and identification of underlying causes. The complexity of the workup supports higher E/M levels.

---

## E/M Level

| Scenario | E/M | Justification |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Localized, obvious cause | 99213 | Low complexity |
| Generalized, workup needed | 99214 | Moderate - data review, differential |
| Systemic workup ordered | 99214 | Lab ordering, differential diagnosis |
| Chronic, management ongoing | 99213-99214 | Chronic condition |

## G2211

Add for chronic/recurrent pruritus requiring ongoing management.

---

## Workup Considerations

### Labs to Consider (increases MDM)
- CBC (polycythemia, eosinophilia)
- CMP (renal, hepatic function)
- TSH (thyroid disease)
- HIV (if risk factors)
- Hepatitis panel
- Iron studies

**Ordering labs = data review = supports 99214**

## Underlying Conditions to Identify

| Finding | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Xerosis | Separate diagnosis, counseling |
| Eczema | Primary diagnosis upgrade, G2211 |
| Scabies | Treatment, possibly family treatment |
| Contact dermatitis | Patch testing opportunity |
| Drug eruption | Higher MDM, drug management |
| Urticaria | Separate diagnosis, workup |
| Dermatitis herpetiformis | Biopsy, celiac workup |
| Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma | Biopsy, staging |
| Psoriasis | Primary diagnosis, treatment |

## Procedure Opportunities

### Biopsy
- If diagnosis unclear, biopsy indicated
- 11104 (punch) preferred for inflammatory: 0.81 wRVU

### KOH Prep
- If fungal infection suspected

### Scabies Prep
- If scabies suspected

---

## Billing Examples

### Pruritus with Xerosis
- 99213 + G2211 = 1.63 wRVU

### Generalized Pruritus, Labs Ordered
- 99214 + G2211 = 2.25 wRVU

### Pruritus with Biopsy
- 99214-25 + 11104 + G2211 = 3.06 wRVU

## Documentation Template

> "Chief complaint: Pruritus, [localized/generalized], duration [X].
>
> Associated symptoms: [rash, xerosis, systemic symptoms]
> 
> Review of systems: [weight loss, night sweats, fatigue - systemic causes]
>
> Exam: [skin findings, lymphadenopathy check, liver/spleen if indicated]
>
> Assessment: Pruritus, [with identified cause / of undetermined etiology]
>
> Plan: [Labs ordered / Biopsy performed / Empiric treatment / Referral]"

## "Next Time" Points

- Generalized pruritus without rash warrants systemic workup → supports 99214
- Identify underlying dermatosis (eczema, psoriasis) → specific diagnosis + G2211
- Consider biopsy if diagnosis unclear
- Document review of systems for systemic causes
- Labs ordered = data element for MDM
