# Clinical Scenario: Skin Cancer Surveillance

## Overview

Skin cancer surveillance visits are for patients with history of melanoma, multiple NMSCs, or high-risk features. These qualify for G2211 as ongoing chronic management.

## E/M Level

| Scenario | E/M | Justification |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Routine surveillance, no findings | 99213 | Established, low MDM |
| Multiple concerning lesions | 99214 | Moderate complexity |
| History of melanoma, high anxiety | 99214 | Chronic management, counseling |
| New suspicious lesion found | 99214 | Increased complexity |

## G2211: YES - Always Add

Skin cancer surveillance IS chronic disease management. Add G2211 to every visit.

**wRVU:** +0.33 per visit

## Procedure Opportunities

### Biopsy of Suspicious Lesions
| Code | Description | wRVU |
|------|-------------|------|
| 11102 | Shave biopsy, first | 0.64 |
| 11103 | Shave biopsy, each addl | 0.37 |
| 11104 | Punch biopsy, first | 0.81 |
| 11105 | Punch biopsy, each addl | 0.44 |

### Destruction of AKs
- Count all AKs treated
- 17000 + 17003 series

### Full Body Photography
- If offered, may be separately billable depending on setup

## Comorbidities to Look For

| Finding | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Actinic keratoses | Destruction (17000+) |
| Atypical nevi | Biopsy consideration |
| Seborrheic keratoses (symptomatic) | Removal (17110) |
| New primary skin cancer | Biopsy, treatment planning |
| Immunosuppression | Higher MDM, more frequent surveillance |
| Field cancerization | Document, may support photodynamic therapy |

---

## Risk Stratification Documentation

Document risk factors to support surveillance frequency:
- Personal history of melanoma (stage, date)
- Personal history of NMSC (number, types)
- Dysplastic nevus syndrome
- Family history of melanoma
- Immunosuppression
- History of radiation
- Fair skin, extensive sun damage

---

## Billing Examples

### Routine Surveillance, No Findings
- 99213 + G2211 = 1.63 wRVU

### Surveillance with AK Treatment
- 99213-25 + G2211 + 17000 + 17003×5 = 1.63 + 1.06 = 2.69 wRVU

### Surveillance with Biopsy
- 99214-25 + G2211 + 11102 = 1.92 + 0.33 + 0.64 = 2.89 wRVU

### High-Risk Patient, Multiple Biopsies
- 99214-25 + G2211 + 11104 + 11105×2 = 1.92 + 0.33 + 1.69 = 3.94 wRVU

## Documentation Template

> "Skin cancer surveillance visit. History: [melanoma stage/date OR X NMSCs, most recent date]. Risk factors: [list]. 
>
> Full body skin examination performed including scalp, face, ears, neck, trunk, extremities, hands, feet, nails.
>
> Findings: [describe any concerning lesions, AKs, etc.]
>
> [Procedures performed]
>
> Assessment: [Stable surveillance / New concerning lesion identified]
> Plan: Return in [3/6/12] months for continued surveillance. [Any additional workup]"

## "Next Time" Points

- **G2211 on EVERY surveillance visit** - this is chronic management (+0.33 wRVU)
- Count and treat all AKs found
- Consider biopsy of any changing or atypical lesions
- Document risk factors to support surveillance interval
- Look for symptomatic SKs patient may want removed
