# Clinical Scenario: Acne Visit

## Overview

Acne visits are among the most common in dermatology and offer significant optimization opportunities through proper identification of billable comorbidities and procedures.

## Baseline Billing

### E/M Level Determination

| Acne Severity | Typical E/M | MDM Justification |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Mild, topical only | 99213 | Low: 1 chronic stable, Rx management |
| Moderate, oral Rx | 99213-99214 | Low-Moderate: Rx requiring monitoring |
| Severe, isotretinoin | 99214 | Moderate: Drug requiring monitoring |
| Acne + comorbidities | 99214 | Moderate: Multiple conditions |

### G2211 Applicability

**YES** - Acne is a chronic condition requiring ongoing management.

Add G2211 to every established patient acne visit (+0.33 wRVU).

---

## Procedure Opportunities

### Comedone Extraction (10040)

**When billable:**
- Comedones extracted during visit
- Medical indication (acne surgery)

**wRVU:** 0.89

**Documentation:**
> "Acne surgery with comedone extraction performed. Multiple open and closed comedones expressed from bilateral cheeks and forehead."

### Intralesional Injection (11900/11901)

**Indications:**
- Inflamed cysts
- Nodular lesions
- Keloid/hypertrophic acne scars

**wRVU:** 0.51 (1-7 lesions) / 0.78 (8+ lesions)

**Documentation:**
> "Intralesional triamcinolone 2.5mg/mL injected into 3 inflamed acne cysts on chin and jawline. Total volume: 0.3mL."

### Milia Extraction (10040)

**When billable:**
- Milia incised and expressed
- Uses same code as comedone extraction

### Chemical Peel for PIH (17360)

**Medical indication:**
- Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from acne
- NOT purely cosmetic

**wRVU:** 0.75

**Documentation:**
> "Chemical peel with glycolic acid for treatment of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation secondary to inflammatory acne. PIH present on bilateral cheeks."

---

## Comorbidities to Look For

### Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)

**Finding:** Dark spots in areas of prior acne lesions

**Opportunity:**
- Adds to MDM complexity
- Chemical peel billable (17360)
- May require separate prescription (hydroquinone)

**Ask:** "Do you notice dark spots where pimples heal?"

### Acne Scarring

**Finding:** Ice pick, boxcar, or rolling scars; keloidal scars

**Opportunities:**
- IL injection for keloidal scars (11900)
- Document for higher MDM if extensive
- Plan for future procedures (subcision, laser)

### Secondary Bacterial Infection

**Finding:** Impetigo, folliculitis superimposed on acne

**Opportunity:**
- Separate condition = higher MDM
- May warrant bacterial culture
- Separate antibiotic consideration

### Rosacea Component

**Finding:** Central facial erythema, telangiectasias, papules

**Opportunity:**
- Second diagnosis
- Separate treatment plan
- Higher MDM

### Seborrheic Dermatitis

**Finding:** Scaling in nasolabial folds, scalp, brows

**Opportunity:**
- Additional diagnosis
- Separate treatment
- Higher MDM

## Visit Optimization Checklist

### Before the Visit
- [ ] Review if isotretinoin patient (monthly = 99214 minimum)
- [ ] Check for prior IL injections or extractions

### During Exam
- [ ] Assess for PIH → chemical peel opportunity
- [ ] Identify inflamed cysts → IL injection opportunity
- [ ] Check for comedones → extraction opportunity
- [ ] Look for scarring → document, IL injection for keloidal
- [ ] Evaluate for rosacea overlap
- [ ] Check scalp/ears for seborrheic dermatitis
- [ ] Ask about dark spots, textural concerns

### At Checkout
- [ ] Ensure all procedures coded
- [ ] G2211 added for chronic management
- [ ] -25 on E/M if procedures performed

## Billing Examples

### Example 1: Simple Acne Follow-up

**Visit:** Stable acne, refill topicals

**Billing:**
- 99213 (stable chronic condition)
- G2211 (chronic management add-on)

**wRVU:** 1.30 + 0.33 = 1.63

### Example 2: Acne with Cyst Injection

**Visit:** Acne with 2 inflamed cysts injected

**Billing:**
- 99213-25 (acne management, separate from injection)
- 11900 (IL injection, ≤7 lesions)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.30 + 0.51 + 0.33 = 2.14

### Example 3: Acne with Multiple Procedures

**Visit:** Acne with PIH, 4 cysts injected, comedone extraction

**Billing:**
- 99214-25 (multiple conditions: acne + PIH)
- 11900 (IL injection, 4 lesions)
- 10040 (comedone extraction)
- 17360 (chemical peel for PIH)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 0.51 + 0.89 + 0.75 + 0.33 = 4.40

### Example 4: Isotretinoin Management

**Visit:** Monthly isotretinoin follow-up, labs reviewed

**Billing:**
- 99214 (drug requiring monitoring, labs reviewed)
- G2211

**wRVU:** 1.92 + 0.33 = 2.25

## Documentation Templates

### Standard Acne Visit
> "Follow-up for acne vulgaris. Current regimen: [medications]. Examination reveals [comedonal/inflammatory/nodulocystic] acne on [locations]. [Number] active inflammatory lesions noted. [Any PIH/scarring]. Continue current therapy with [modifications]. Return in [timeframe]."

### With IL Injection
> "In addition to above, [number] inflamed [cysts/nodules] identified on [locations]. Intralesional triamcinolone [concentration] injected. Total volume [X]mL."

### With Extraction
> "Acne surgery performed with expression of comedones on [locations]."

### With Chemical Peel
> "Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation noted on [locations]. Chemical peel with [agent] applied for treatment of PIH secondary to inflammatory acne."

---

## "Next Time" Teaching Points

### If no PIH addressed:
> "For future visits: Assess for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. If present, chemical peel (17360, 0.75 wRVU) is billable with medical indication."

### If cysts not injected:
> "For future visits: Any inflamed cysts can be injected with IL steroid (11900, 0.51 wRVU). Ask about any tender bumps."

### If comedones not extracted:
> "For future visits: Comedone extraction (10040, 0.89 wRVU) is billable during acne visits when performed."

### If G2211 not added:
> "For future visits: Add G2211 (+0.33 wRVU) to every established patient acne visit as a chronic condition."
