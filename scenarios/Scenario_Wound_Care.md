# Clinical Scenario: Wound Care / Ulcer Visit

## Overview
Wound care visits offer debridement, E/M, and treatment of underlying conditions.

---

## Debridement Codes

| Depth | First 20 sq cm | Each addl 20 sq cm | wRVU |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|------|
| Subcutaneous | 11042 | 11045 | 0.98/0.55 |
| Muscle/fascia | 11043 | 11046 | 2.63/0.78 |
| Bone | 11044 | 11047 | 4.00/0.97 |

**Key:** Depth determines code, not size.

---

## Measurement

- Measure wound in square centimeters
- Document depth of debridement
- Document tissue debrided (necrotic, biofilm, etc.)

---

## Comorbidities

| Finding | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Stasis dermatitis | Separate diagnosis |
| Secondary infection | Higher MDM, separate Rx |
| Contact dermatitis to dressings | Patch testing |
| Venous insufficiency | Underlying cause documentation |
| Diabetic neuropathy | Higher complexity |

## Billing Examples

### Simple Wound Debridement
- 99213-25 + 11042 = 2.28 wRVU

### Large Wound, Deep Debridement
- 99214-25 + 11043 = 4.55 wRVU

### Wound with Stasis Dermatitis
- 99214 + 11042 + G2211 = 3.23 wRVU

## Documentation

> "Chronic wound of [location], [dimensions] = [X] sq cm. [Necrotic tissue/biofilm/slough] present. Sharp debridement performed to [subcutaneous/muscle/bone] level. Wound bed now [description]. [Dressing applied]."

---

## "Next Time" Points
- Document DEPTH of debridement (determines code)
- Measure wound in sq cm
- Look for stasis dermatitis → separate diagnosis
- Check for contact allergy to wound products → patch testing
- G2211 for chronic wound management
