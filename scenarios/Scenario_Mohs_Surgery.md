# Clinical Scenario: Mohs Micrographic Surgery

## Overview

Mohs surgery is the highest-revenue procedure in dermatology. Optimization requires meticulous documentation of stages, blocks, and reconstruction.

## Mohs Billing Structure

### Stage 1 - Head/Neck/Hands/Feet/Genitalia/Special Stain

| Code | Description | wRVU |
|------|-------------|------|
| 17311 | First stage, up to 5 blocks | 10.10 |
| 17312 | Each additional block beyond 5 | 0.95 |

### Stages 2+ - Head/Neck/Hands/Feet/Genitalia/Special Stain

| Code | Description | wRVU |
|------|-------------|------|
| 17313 | Each additional stage, up to 5 blocks | 6.57 |

| 17316 | Each additional block beyond 5 | 0.81 |

### Stages 2+ - Trunk/Arms/Legs

|------|-------------|------|
| 17317 | Each additional stage, up to 5 blocks | 5.10 |

## Critical Documentation Elements

### Required for Each Stage

1. **Stage number**
2. **Number of tissue blocks**
3. **Margin status** (positive or negative for each section)
4. **Tumor type confirmed**
5. **Mapping documentation**

### Tumor Map

Must include:
- Orientation (12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, etc.)
- Location of positive margins (if any)
- Defect size after each stage

---

## Block Counting

### What Constitutes a Block

Each separately processed tissue section = 1 block

**Examples:**
- Large tumor requiring 4 pieces for stage 1 = 4 blocks
- Small tumor with 2 pieces = 2 blocks
- Deep margin processed separately = additional block

### Counting for Billing

| Stage 1 Blocks | Coding (H/N/HF/G) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 3 blocks | 17311 |
| 5 blocks | 17311 |
| 6 blocks | 17311 + 17312 |
| 8 blocks | 17311 + 17312 x3 |

| Stage 2+ Blocks | Coding (H/N/HF/G) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 3 blocks | 17313 |
| 5 blocks | 17313 |
| 7 blocks | 17313 + 17314 x2 |

## Reconstruction Billing

### Separately Billable

Mohs + reconstruction are SEPARATE procedures. Bill for BOTH.

### Reconstruction Options (most to least wRVU)

| Reconstruction | Code Range | Typical wRVU |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Flap (nose/ear 10.1-30 sq cm) | 14061 | 11.19 |
| Flap (nose/ear ≤10 sq cm) | 14060 | 9.00 |
| Flap (face 10.1-30 sq cm) | 14041 | 10.56 |
| Flap (face ≤10 sq cm) | 14040 | 8.39 |
| FTSG | 15260+ | Varies |
| Complex repair (nose/ear) | 13151-13153 | 4.23-5.21+ |
| Complex repair (face) | 13131-13133 | 3.64-4.66+ |
| Intermediate repair (face) | 12051-12057 | 2.27-3.41+ |
| Second intention | None | $0 |

### Flap Measurement Reminder

**CRITICAL: Primary defect + Secondary defect = Total flap size**

| Stage 2, 3 blocks | 17313 | 6.57 |
| Intermediate repair face 2.0cm | 12051 | 2.27 |
| **Total** | | **18.94** |

### Example 2: Complex 3-Stage Mohs with Flap

**Procedure:** SCC temple, 3 stages (6, 4, 2 blocks), rotation flap

| Component | Code | wRVU |
|-----------|------|------|
| Stage 1, 6 blocks | 17311 + 17312 | 10.10 + 0.95 = 11.05 |
| Stage 2, 4 blocks | 17313 | 6.57 |
| Stage 3, 2 blocks | 17313 | 6.57 |
| Rotation flap face, 15 sq cm | 14041 | 10.56 |
| **Total** | | **34.75** |

### Example 3: Mohs Trunk

**Procedure:** BCC back, 2 stages, 4 blocks each, intermediate repair

| Component | Code | wRVU |

| Stage 2, 4 blocks | 17317 | 5.10 |
| Intermediate repair trunk 3.0cm | 12032 | 2.46 |
| **Total** | | **15.44** |

### Example 4: Multiple Tumors Same Day

**Procedure:** 2 BCCs - nose (2 stages) and cheek (1 stage)

| Component | Code | wRVU |
|-----------|------|------|
| Tumor 1: Stage 1 | 17311 | 10.10 |
| Tumor 1: Stage 2 | 17313 | 6.57 |
| Tumor 2: Stage 1 | 17311-59 | 10.10 |
| Reconstruction (each tumor) | Varies | Varies |
| **Mohs Only Total** | | **26.77** |

## Reconstruction Optimization

### Flap Selection

**When flap is appropriate:**
- Wound cannot be closed primarily
- Tissue mobility insufficient for linear closure
- Cosmetic or functional benefit from flap

**Measurement:**
- Primary defect: Measure before flap design
- Secondary defect: Measure created donor defect
- Total: Add both for code selection

### Repair Complexity

**Complex repair indicators:**
- Wound edge debridement
- Scar revision
- Extensive undermining with tissue rearrangement
- Retention sutures

**Document complexity factors** to support complex (vs intermediate) coding.

## Common Underbilling Errors

| Error | Correction |
|-------|------------|
| Not counting all blocks | Count each tissue block per stage |
| Missing add-on blocks | Bill 17312/17314/17316 for blocks >5 |
| Not billing stages 2+ | Each stage is separately billable |
| Flap: only primary defect | Measure PRIMARY + SECONDARY |
| Using repair instead of flap | Consider if flap is more appropriate |
| Complex as intermediate | Document complexity factors |
| Missing reconstruction entirely | Always bill reconstruction separately |

---

## "Next Time" Teaching Points

### If blocks not maximized:
> "Count every tissue block. >5 blocks in a stage = add-on codes (17312/17314)."

### If reconstruction undercoded:
> "Evaluate highest-complexity reconstruction supportable. Flap often more appropriate than repair if tissue rearrangement required."

### If flap undermeasured:
> "Flap size = PRIMARY + SECONDARY defect. Both must be measured and documented."

### If complex repair coded as intermediate:
> "Document complexity factors: debridement, scar revision, extensive undermining. These support complex coding."
